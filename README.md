## How It Works

### Step 1: Choose Your Interview Parameters
Users start by customizing their interview experience:
- Select the type of interview round (Technical, HR, Behavioral, etc.).
- Choose the job role and industry you are preparing for.
- Specify the technology stack you want to be tested on.
- Set your level of experience to get the most relevant questions.

### Step 2: Conduct Your Mock Interview
Once the parameters are set, the AI generates tailored questions. Users respond verbally, and the AI listens and interacts in real-time, simulating a live interview scenario. This helps users experience the pressure and spontaneity of a real interview.

### Step 3: Receive Detailed Feedback
After completing the mock interview, users receive a detailed feedback report:
